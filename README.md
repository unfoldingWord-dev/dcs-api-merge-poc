# Proof of Concept for using DCS API to merge branches WITH conflicts.

This is a proof of concept for showing a repo can be set up, a master branch initialized with files, a user branch made, and then changes are made to both branches, and then the user branch can be merged into master, all using the DCS/Gitea API. There will be conflicts, so the script stops and notes as such.
