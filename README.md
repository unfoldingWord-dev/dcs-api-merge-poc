# Proof of Concept to use DCS API to resolve two files that have conflicts from a common original file.

This is a proof of concept for showing a repo can be set up, a master branch initialized with files, a user branch made, and then changes are made to both branches, and then the user branch can be merged into master, all using the DCS/Gitea API.
